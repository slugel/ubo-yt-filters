# uBO YouTube Filters

Custom filters for YouTube that make it less distracting by:
- Removing Shorts embeds from search and home screens (if you choose to keep the home feed)
- Disabling comments and suggestions at the end and side of videos
- Removing suggestions from the home screen and search
- Removing the sidebar and top-right bar

## Usage
To use this filter list, follow these steps:
- Copy the contents of `filters.txt`.
- Open uBO settings by clicking on the extension icon and then the gear icon.
- Switch to the "My filters" tab, then paste the contents.
- Press "Apply changes" and refresh the YouTube page.

For any filters you do not want applied, you can simply omit or remove them after pasting.
